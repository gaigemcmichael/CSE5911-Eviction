# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.

# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.
# Happy Jekylling!
# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
