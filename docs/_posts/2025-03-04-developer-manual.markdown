## Installation Instructions

### Windows 10

#### 1\. Install WSL & Ubuntu

Follow the [GoRails Windows 10 setup](https://gorails.com/setup/windows) (including the Rails installation). **Do not follow the database installation steps.**

#### 2\. Set Up Visual Studio Code

a. Install the WSL extension and SQL Server extensions.  
b. Open a new VS Code window with the command:
```!whitespace-pre
code .
```

#### 3\. Set Up Git & Permissions

a. In the WSL or Ubuntu terminal, run:

```!whitespace-pre
sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d -o metadata
sudo umount /mnt/d
wsl --shutdown
```

> **Note:** Replace `D:` with your drive letter.

b. Navigate to the desired folder and run:
`git clone <ssh link to repository>`

**Potential Problem:** If you encounter an error when trying to clone the repository (for example):

`error: chmod on /mnt/d/eviction1/CSE5915_Eviction1/.git/config.lock failed: Operation not permitted fatal: could not set 'core.filemode' to 'false'`

**Solution:** Run:

```!whitespace-pre
sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d -o metadata
sudo umount /mnt/d
```

After this, open Windows PowerShell and execute:

```!whitespace-pre
wsl --shutdown
```

Finally, retry the Git clone command.

#### 4\. Install Required Gems

a. In the WSL or Ubuntu terminal, run:

```!whitespace-pre
sudo apt-get --assume-yes update
curl -sSL https://rvm.io/pkuczynski.asc | gpg -
import -
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io/ | bash -s stable

# *ENSURE YOU RUN THE COMMAND SPECIFIED IN THE RECENT OUTPUT TO CONSOLE, THEN PROCEED BELOW*

rvm install "ruby-3.4.1"
sudo apt-get --assume-yes
install freetds-dev freetds-bin
bundle install
```

#### 5\. Install SQL Server

a. Download and install Microsoft SQL Server Developer Edition.

#### 6\. Configure SQL Server

a. Enable TCP/IP in SQL Server Configuration Manager.  
b. Set the port to 1433 and update `database.yml` to match the specified configuration settings.

#### 7\. Firewall Settings

a. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

```!whitespace-pre
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow SQL Server
from WSL" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -
LocalPort 1433 -Action Allow
```

#### 8\. Initialize Database

a. In the terminal, run:

```!whitespace-pre
rails db:create
rails db:drop
```

b. Add proper dependencies for SQL Server by running:

```!whitespace-pre
curl
https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | 
sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "$(curl -fsSL
https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/prod.list)"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mssql-tools unixodbc-dev -y
# Accept the terms, then:
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >>
~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

c. Ensure the SQL Browser service is installed and running:

*   In PowerShell, run:
    
    ```!whitespace-pre
    Get-Service -Name SQLBrowser
    ```
    
*   If the service is stopped, run:
    
    ```!whitespace-pre
    Start-Service -Name SQLBrowser
    ```
    
*   If you cannot start it via the command line, open **Run** (Windows key + R), type `services.msc`, and hit enter. Locate **SQL Server Browser**, right-click, select **Properties**, change the **Startup Type** to **Manual**, and then start the service.

d. Check for a connection to the database (replace IP, username, and password as needed):

```!whitespace-pre
sqlcmd -S 172.21.176.1 -U sa -P changeme
```

If successfully connected, you should see a prompt similar to: `1>`

Then, to check for existing databases, type:

```!whitespace-pre
1> SELECT name FROM sys.databases;
2> GO
```

If the desired database is not present, create it:

*   Create the database (replace `EVICTION_TEST` with your database name):
    
    ```!whitespace-pre
    1> CREATE DATABASE EVICTION_TEST;
    2> GO
    ```
    
*   Then select it:
    
    ```!whitespace-pre
    1> USE EVICTION_TEST;
    2> GO
    ```

e. To initialize from the `DBInitTest.sql` file (replace username, password, IP, and database name as needed), run:

```!whitespace-pre
sqlcmd -S 172.21.176.1 -U sa -P changeme -d
EVICTION_TEST -i "DBInitTest.sql"
```

f. Run the migrations:

```!whitespace-pre
rails db:migrate
```

### macOS (M1)

#### 1\. Install Prerequisites

a. Install **Homebrew**:

```!whitespace-pre
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install docker
```

b. Install **Docker** for Mac with Apple Silicon – see the [Docker Setup for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).

c. Follow the [GoRails macOS 14 Setup](https://gorails.com/setup/macos/14-sonoma) to install **Ruby on Rails**:

*   Follow the linked tutorial and complete the instructions up to and including the Rails installation (do not install the database).
    

#### 2\. Run MS SQL Server in Docker

a. Refer to [Setting Up A Local SQL Server on a Mac](https://medium.com/@aleksej.gudkov/how-to-set-up-a-local-sql-server-on-an-m1-mac-88d0ff0fed4c) for guidance.

b. Start the SQL Server container by running:

```!whitespace-pre
docker run mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge
docker run -p 1433:1433 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=StrongPassword1" -p 1433:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge docker ps
docker ps
```

#### 3\. Run in the VS Code Terminal

a. Clone your Git repository.  
b. Update `database.yml` with your specific configuration.  
c. Run the following commands:

```!whitespace-pre
bundle install
ruby ./bin/rails server
```

This will start the application; the database is initialized in the container (not locally).

#### 4\. Initialize Database

a. Create a folder on your local machine (e.g., `SQLData`) in the same directory where you cloned the Git repository.  
b. Open the **Docker** terminal and run:

```!whitespace-pre
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=StrongPassword1" -p 1433:1433 -v ./SQLData:/var/opt/mssql --name sqlserver -d --rm mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sql-edge
```

> **Notes:**
> 
> *   The `-v ./SQLData:/var/opt/mssql` flag saves the database to your local machine.
>     
> *   The container is named `sqlserver` with the `--name` flag.
>     
> *   The `--rm` flag ensures that the container is removed when stopped.
>     

c. In VS Code, run:

```!whitespace-pre
ruby ./bin/rails server
```

d. Whenever you need to run Docker, use the command from step 4b.

e. Download [MS Azure Data Studio](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/sql-server-management-studio-mac).

f. **Install MS SQL CLI:**

i. Download [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).  
ii. To install and test, run:

```!whitespace-pre
npm install -g sql-cli

# OR

sudo npm install -g sql-cli
mssql -u sa -p
```

g. Install the GUI application – [Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15&viewFallbackFrom=sql-server-ver15%5D&tabs=win-install%2Cwin-user-install%2Credhat-install%2Cwindows-uninstall%2Credhat-uninstall). After installation, add the necessary credentials and click connect.

h. Initialize the database using your DB initialization file.

> **Note:** You can change the `ENV[]` values in your `.env` file (for example, Gmail username and password).

## Source File Locations & Overview

### 1\. Directory Structure

Our project uses the standard Ruby on Rails directory structure. Key points include:

*   **app/**: Contains the main application logic (MVC components)
    
*   **config/**: Manages application settings (database connection and routes file)
    
*   **db/**: Contains database migrations and the schema file (note: these are less critical since our database is external)
    

### 2\. Key Source Files & Functions

*   **MVC Files:** Models, controllers, and views are essential.
    
*   **routes.rb:** Lays out the routes connecting our views.
    
*   **schema.rb and database.yml:** While `schema.rb` is typically very important, it is less so in this project because we use an external database. The `database.yml` file connects the project to the external MS SQL Server database (as detailed in the environment setup).
    

### 3\. Configuration Files & Roles

*   **database.yml:** Connects the local database with the Rails application.
    
*   **schema.rb:** Remains in sync with the local database to leverage Rails’ MVC structure effectively.
    

## Running the Application

### Starting the Server

To start the server, run either:

```!whitespace-pre
rails s
```
or
```!whitespace-pre
rails server
```

A message should confirm that the server is online. In VS Code, you may also be prompted to view the application in your browser. If not, access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Navigating the Application

The pages can be navigated via the top navigation bar:

| Home | Messages | Documents | Account |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Different account types have access to different pages. For example, a landlord account may manage multiple mediations simultaneously, while a tenant is limited to one active mediation. **More details will be added as functionality (e.g., admin roles) is implemented.**

## Test Suite & Manual Tests

### Automated Tests

Rails uses **Continuous Integration Tests** to automatically scan for known Ruby and JavaScript vulnerabilities and to check for consistent styling via lint tools. CI tests can be configured by modifying the `CI.yml` file located in the `.github` folder.

### Running the Test Suite

Rails’ built-in testing framework executes tests located under the `test/` folder. Run:

```!whitespace-pre
rails test
```

to execute all tests. To run tests for a specific component (for example, controllers), use:

```!whitespace-pre
rails test:controllers
```

(replace `controllers` with the desired test subcategory).

### Manual Tests

Running the automated test suite will execute all current test cases. For guidance on developing additional test cases, refer to the [Testing Rails Applications — Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html).

## Unique Aspects & Known Issues

### Unique Features

The primary unique feature of this application is the use of Microsoft SQL Server with Ruby on Rails—an unorthodox pairing that can lead to technical challenges during setup.

### Common Issues

Currently, there are no broadly documented common issues. Any SQL Server setup issues have been addressed in the latest setup instructions. Unresolved issues will be documented as they are encountered.

### Troubleshooting Development Issues

One member’s Windows 11 device is still unable to connect to a local instance of SQL Server at the time of writing. If a solution is discovered, it will be added to this section.
