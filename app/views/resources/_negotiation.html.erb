    <h1 class="resx-info-title">Negotiation &amp; Mediation: What They Are and How They Can Help</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="resx-info-subtitle">
    This page explains what negotiation and mediation are, how they support both tenants and landlords,
    and when these tools are most useful.
  </p>

  <div class="resx-info-grid">
    <div class="resx-info-card">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-comments"></i>What is negotiation?</h3>
      <p>
        Negotiation is a back-and-forth conversation between a tenant and a landlord to try to solve a housing
        problem early. Most eviction cases start because communication breaks down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Negotiation gives both sides a chance to explain what is going on, share documents, and try to reach an
        agreement before an eviction is filed.
      </p>
      <p>Negotiation is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Voluntary</li>
        <li>A chance to talk directly</li>
        <li>A way to avoid court</li>
        <li>Often faster and less stressful</li>
        <li>Private and done at your own pace</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Negotiation is not legal advice, and it does not force anyone into an agreement.
        Agreements are usually only enforceable if both sides sign a written document.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="resx-info-card">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-scale-unbalanced"></i>What is mediation?</h3>
      <p>
        Mediation is when a trained, neutral mediator joins the conversation only if needed.
        Franklin County has limited mediation staff, so mediation is reserved for situations
        where negotiation has been tried first.
      </p>
      <p>Mediation helps by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making sure each person has a chance to be heard</li>
        <li>Helping the parties understand their options</li>
        <li>Reducing the emotional stress of eviction</li>
        <li>Giving structure to difficult conversations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A mediator does not take sides and cannot give legal advice. They help both sides work toward a
        solution that feels fair.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="resx-info-card">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-user-shield"></i>How these tools help tenants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Preventing an eviction filing entirely when issues are caught early</li>
        <li>Giving tenants time to communicate with the landlord</li>
        <li>Helping tenants understand what they are agreeing to</li>
        <li>Avoiding signing something “just to agree” when it may not be realistic</li>
        <li>Providing a trauma-informed space that is easier to navigate than court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This process helps tenants advocate for themselves, ask questions, and work toward a plan that
        makes sense for their situation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="resx-info-card">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-briefcase"></i>How these tools help landlords</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reducing the need to file an eviction (and avoiding filing fees)</li>
        <li>Saving time by preventing court hearings</li>
        <li>Decreasing turnover costs and vacancy time</li>
        <li>Reducing property damage by lowering conflict with frustrated tenants</li>
        <li>Creating early communication before rent becomes significantly late</li>
        <li>Providing a structured space to talk through issues</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These tools let landlords reach agreements faster and with less stress.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="resx-info-card">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-bell"></i>Why early communication matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most evictions are for non-payment of rent, not intentional wrongdoing.</li>
        <li>Many issues could be solved early if landlords and tenants talked sooner.</li>
        <li>Eviction is traumatic—especially for families, children, and vulnerable renters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By opening a conversation early, both sides have a chance to avoid court, avoid trauma,
        preserve housing stability, and reach workable solutions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="resx-info-card">
      <h3><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i>When to use negotiation or mediation</h3>
      <p>You can use these tools when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rent is late</li>
        <li>There is confusion about the lease</li>
        <li>There is a disagreement about repairs or fees</li>
        <li>Important documents need to be shared</li>
        <li>Communication is breaking down</li>
        <li>You want to try resolving things before going to court</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our text-based tool allows parties to negotiate directly with each other to reach a solution.
        Then, if progress stalls, a mediator can join the conversation.
